//! Auto-generated Rust bindings for *Illumination Research*’s *Nodal
//! Scene Interface* – ɴsɪ.
//!
//! You should not need to use this crate directly except for two
//! reasons. You are likely either:
//! * a masochist who wants to use the C-API directly from Rust.
//! * Not happy with my high level Rust binding (see below) – consider
//!   opening an issue [here](https://github.com/virtualritz/nsi/issues)
//!   instead.
//! * writing a renderer that exposes an ɴsɪ C-API.
//!
//! # High Level Bindings
//!
//! There are high level Rust bindings for this API in the
//! [ɴsɪ crate](https://crates.io/crates/nsi/).
//!
//! ## Differences From The C API
//!
//! All `enum`s have been rustified – they were mapped to actual Rust `enum`s.
//!
//! Postfixes were stripped on `enum` and `struct` type names. E.g.:
//!
//! [`NSIParam_t`](https://github.com/virtualritz/nsi-sys/blob/f1f05da59b558f9dd18f7afd37aa82d72b73b7da/include/nsi.h#L69-L77)
//! ⟶ [`NSIParam`]
//!
//! Prefixes and postfixes were stripped on `enum` variants. E.g.:
//!
//! [`NSIType_t`](https://github.com/virtualritz/nsi-sys/blob/f1f05da59b558f9dd18f7afd37aa82d72b73b7da/include/nsi.h#L27-L41)`::NSITypeInvalid`
//! ⟶ [`NSIType`]`::Invalid`
//!
//! Rationale: make code using the bindings a bit less convoluted resp. easier
//! to read.
//!
//! Finally, [`NSIParamFlags`] is a [`bitflags`](https://docs.rs/bitflags)
//! `struct` that wraps the `NSIParam*` flags from the C-API for ergnomics.
//!
//! # Compile- vs. Runtime
//!
//! The crate builds as-is, with default features.
//!
//! However, at runtime this crate requires a library/renderer that
//! implements the ɴsɪ C-API to link against. Currently the only
//! renderer that does is [*3Delight*](https://www.3delight.com/).
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * `download_lib3delight` – Fetches the dynamic library version of *3Delight
//!   2.1.2* for *Linux*, *macOS* or *Windows*.
//!
//!   This can be used as a fallback, to build against, if you do not have the
//!   renderer installed on your system. But it is an old version of 3Delight
//!   and foremost a CI feature.
//!
//!   It is instead suggested that you [download a *3Delight*
//!   package](https://www.3delight.com/download) for your platform & install
//!   it. This will set the `DELIGHT` environment variable that the build
//!   script is looking for to find a locally installed library to link
//!   against. Free version renders with up to 12 cores.
//!
//!   This will also install *3Delight Display* which you can render to,
//!   progressively – useful for debugging.
//!
//! * `link_lib3delight` – Links against the dynamic library version of
//!   3Delight. Requires the `DELIGHT` environment variable to be set.
//!
//! * `omit_functions` – Omit generating bindings for the API's functions. This
//!   is for the case where you want to expose your own C-API hooks from your
//!   renderer.
